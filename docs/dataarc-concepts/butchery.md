
## Butchery

###  Scope note: 
"Butchery" denotes the processing of animal products. Butchery practices are often selective in the population of animals targeted. Butchery practices may respond to and reflect social, economic or environmental factors. Butchery is not restricted to domestic animal populations. Skeletal (zooarchaeological) elements are a key source of evidence for butchery in the archaeological record.  

### Examples: 

* The intentional removal of marrow from animal bones during the processing of the carcass. 

* The separation of fish heads from spines during processing.

* The removal of walrun hide through cutting or scraping.
