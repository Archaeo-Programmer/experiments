###  Scope note: 
"Grazing" denotes the intentional and managed gathering of domestic animals in designated locations where they consumed grass as a primary food source. Grazing is often seasonal, practiced for only part of the year in a given location. Grazing practices respond to and reflect, social, economic and environmental factors. Grazing may be associated with soil conditions. Key sources of evidence for grazing as a practice include documentary discussion, field boundaries and routeways preserved in the archaeological record, and pollen and other botanical evidence for grasses.

### Examples: 

* The communal management of hay crops through the construction of walls enclosing the areas dedicated to hay production.   

* The planting of alliums (onion and garlic) in monastic gardens at Skriðuklaustur.

* The enrichment of homefield areas with fertilizer.
