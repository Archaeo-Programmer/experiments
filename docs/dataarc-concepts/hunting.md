###  Scope note: 
"Hunting" denotes the intentional pursuit and capture or kiling of wild marine and terrestrial mammals and birds for purposes of procuring food or other animal products. 

### Examples: 

* The Grágás law book, dating to the 13th c., discussed the rules over the ownership of hunted and walrus along the Icelandic coast.

* Viking hunting of Walrus was motivated by a market for walrus-tusk ivory and walrus-hide rope, as well as meat for consumption.
