## Food Preparation

###  Scope note: 
"Food Preparation" denotes the final stages of processing of plant or animal products for storage or consumption. These activities including tertiary butchery, preserving with salt or smoke, and all forms of cooking.

### Examples: 

* Cooking pits have been excavated at Hofstadir. A large pit excavated at this site was interpreted as suggesting large scale food preparation connected to ritual feasting, though this interpretation has been questioned.

* Some burnt animal bone in middens at Skutustadir has been interpreted as being associated with food preparation. The degree of burning is an important factor in making this assessment.
