## Beached Whale 

###  Scope note: 
"Beached Whale" refers to the washing up of whales onto beaches. This can be the consequence of many things, i.e. dead whales washing up on beaches due to currents and wave action, or sick or disoriented whales washing up on beaches due to storms and other variables and then dying. In the premodern European North Atlantic a beached whale can generally be seen as a asset for whatever group was able to claim ownership over the carcass. In Iceland for example, different groups had the rights to beached whales by legal right. The term 'hvalreki' in Icelandic refers both to a beached whale but also to a stroke of luck. Whales supplied meat, fat, oil, bone and if from the right type of whale baleen. Whales appear both in coastal as well as inland archaeological sites in the North Atlantic.

### Examples: 

* The presence of large whale vertebrae used as a butcher's block in an 18th century archaeological context (Skalholt; Hambrecht 2011).
* The presence of large amounts of fragmented and burnt whale bone presumebaly being used as fuel at a 17th century archaeological context (Grof; Hambrecht and Gibbons 2018)
* Whale bone present, and presumeably the refuse from butchering, at medieval coastal fishing sites in Northest Iceland (Akurvik and Gjogur; Edvardsson et al 2004)
