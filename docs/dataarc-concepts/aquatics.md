## Aquatics 

###  Scope note: "Aquatics", or aquatic habitats, are identified in the paleo-ecological record on the basis of evidence such as the presence of beetle species which live in or on water, in any form, from temporary pools to lakes and rivers, the presence of fossil pollen from species whose ecological range includes any form of water, or an assemblage of other plant, insect, or animal remains which are associated with aquatic ecologies.
