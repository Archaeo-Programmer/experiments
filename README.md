[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ropitz/experiments/master)

This repo contains:
- a basic jupyter notebook to explore the data and concepts used in the project
- the project's scope notes which document the concepts in the projects concept map
- static copies of the project's datasets, available as json files
- a static copy of the project's concept map, available as a gml file
- a static copy of the project's list of combinators, aka the mappings between queries on the datasets and the concept map. 

These tools and how to use them are described in our [documentation](https://dataarc-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
